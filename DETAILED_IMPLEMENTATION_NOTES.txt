3D E-COMMERCE CHAIR STORE - DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This project is a modern React + TypeScript e-commerce application showcasing 4 different chair products with advanced 3D visualization and Augmented Reality (AR) capabilities. The application consists of two main pages: a products listing page and individual product detail pages.

================================================================================
REQUIRED PACKAGES AND THEIR ROLES
================================================================================

CORE ROUTING & NAVIGATION:
- react-router-dom (^6.x): Handles client-side routing between the products page and individual product detail pages. Provides BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and navigation hooks like useNavigate and useParams.

3D GRAPHICS AND VISUALIZATION:
- @react-three/fiber (^8.x): React renderer for Three.js that allows declarative 3D scene creation using JSX. This is the foundation for all 3D visualization in the app.
- @react-three/drei (^9.x): Collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber including OrbitControls (for rotation), useGLTF (for loading 3D models), Environment, and Suspense helpers.
- three (^0.160.x): The core 3D graphics library that powers all 3D rendering. Handles WebGL, geometries, materials, lighting, and cameras.
- @types/three: TypeScript definitions for Three.js to ensure type safety.

3D MODEL LOADING:
- three-stdlib: Additional utilities and loaders for Three.js, including enhanced GLTF loader capabilities and post-processing effects.

AUGMENTED REALITY:
- @google/model-viewer (^3.x): Web component that provides easy 3D model viewing with built-in AR capabilities. Handles camera access, AR session management, and model placement in real-world environments.

UI AND STYLING:
- tailwindcss (^3.x): Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent styling across components.
- @headlessui/react (^1.x): Unstyled, accessible UI components like modals, dialogs, and transitions that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.
- lucide-react (^0.x): Modern icon library with React components for UI elements like buttons, navigation, and status indicators.

PHASE 4: 3D VISUALIZATION SYSTEM
--------------------------------
1. ThreeDViewer Component Setup:
   - Create React Three Fiber Canvas with proper camera positioning
   - Implement Suspense boundaries for loading states
   - Set up basic lighting (ambient + directional lights)

2. 3D Model Loading and Display:
   - Use useGLTF hook to load GLB models from assets
   - Position and scale models appropriately in the scene
   - Add environment mapping for realistic reflections

3. Interactive Controls:
   - Implement OrbitControls for mouse/touch rotation
   - Set rotation limits to prevent flipping
   - Add zoom constraints for optimal viewing
   - Enable auto-rotation with pause on interaction

4. Modal Integration:
   - Create modal component to house 3D viewer

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

3D VIEWER IFRAME APPROACH:
The 3D viewer will be implemented in an iframe to isolate the Three.js context and prevent conflicts with the main React application. This approach provides:
- Memory management isolation
- Easier cleanup of WebGL contexts
- Prevention of Three.js conflicts with other libraries
- Better performance on mobile devices

AR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
Using Google Model Viewer provides the most reliable AR experience across devices:
- Automatic device capability detection
- Built-in AR session management
- Proper camera permission handling
- Optimized model rendering for AR

ASSET ORGANIZATION:
The existing asset structure with product folders containing images and GLB files is optimal:
- Each product folder contains all related assets
- GLB files are already optimized for web delivery
- Image files provide fallbacks and gallery content
- Clear naming convention for easy mapping

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- GLB models should be under 5MB each for optimal loading
- Images should be optimized (WebP format recommended)
- Implement progressive loading for better perceived performance
- Use service workers for caching 3D assets

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
- WebGL support required for 3D features (95%+ browser support)
- AR features require modern mobile browsers with camera access
- Fallback UI for unsupported features
- Progressive enhancement approach
